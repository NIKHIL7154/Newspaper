                    <p><span class="headline hl4">by THE HINDU</span></p>
                </div>
                <p> The Indian government has announced a new education policy, the first in 34 years, aimed at making
                    Indian education more holistic, flexible, multidisciplinary, and aligned to the needs of the 21st
                    century and the global best practices. The new policy will replace the 10+2 structure of school
                    curricula with a new 5+3+3+4 design, which corresponds to the age groups 3-8 years (Foundational
                    Stage), 8-11 years (Preparatory), 11-14 years (Middle), and 14-18 years (Secondary). </p>
                <p> The new policy also includes several other significant changes, such as the medium of instruction
                    until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, in mother tongue/local
                    language/regional language; greater focus on critical thinking, creativity, communication, and
                    curiosity; no rigid separation between arts and sciences, between curricular and extra-curricular
                    activities, between vocational and academic education; and increased use of technology in teaching
                    and learning. </p>
                <p> The new policy is expected to benefit millions of students in India by providing them with a more
                    comprehensive and meaningful education that prepares them for the challenges and opportunities of
                    the future. </p>

            </div>
            <p> India's first private lunar mission, TeamIndus, was launched successfully on board a Polar Satellite
                Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The
                mission, which is a part of the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, aims to land a rover on the moon's
                surface and transmit high-definition video, images, and data back to Earth. </p>
            <p> The TeamIndus rover, named ECA (Ek Choti Si Asha), weighs around 600 grams and is equipped with a
                camera, a seismometer, and a laser reflector. The rover is designed to travel up to 500 meters on
                the lunar surface and perform various scientific experiments. </p>
            <p> The successful launch of the TeamIndus mission marks a significant milestone in India's space
                exploration journey and demonstrates the country's growing capabilities in the field of space
                technology. </p>

            </div>
            <p> India's first solar-powered train, the DEMU (Diesel Electric Multiple Unit) train, was unveiled in
                Gujarat by the Indian Railways. The train, which is equipped with 16 solar panels on its roof, can
                generate up to 7.5 kilowatts of power, which is sufficient to meet the electrical needs of the
                train, including lighting, fans, and information systems. </p>
            <p> The solar-powered train, which is a part of the Indian Railways' plan to reduce its carbon footprint
                and promote sustainable energy, is expected to save up to 21,000 liters of diesel and reduce carbon
                emissions by 51,000 kg per year. </p>
            <p> The successful trial of the solar-powered train marks a significant step towards the Indian
                Railways' goal of becoming a net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. </p>

                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
                surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;<p>and, as I lie close to
                    the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world
                    among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies,
                    then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that
                    universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and
                    then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul
                    and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh,
                    would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and
                    warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite
                    God!</p>
